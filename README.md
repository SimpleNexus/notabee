# Notabee

SimpleNexian Shawn Hornet is all about our Company Values of [HIVE](https://www.simplenexus.com/careers/) — Hungry, Innovative, Vibrant, and Empathetic. He's also a big Shakespeare fan. He created this app, Notabee, to save his favorite Shakespeare quotes.

He needs *your* help to finish the app!

## Setting Up the App

In this repo, you'll find two folders:
* The `api` folder is a [Ruby on Rails API](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html) — this is our **backend**
* The `frontend` folder, which is a [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/) Single-Page App — this is our **frontend**
