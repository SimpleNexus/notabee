# Notabee

SimpleNexian Shawn Hornet is all about our Company Values of [HIVE](https://www.simplenexus.com/careers/) â€” Hungry, Innovative, Vibrant, and Empathetic. He's also a big Shakespeare fan. He created this app, Notabee, to save his favorite Shakespeare quotes.

He needs *your* help to finish the app!

## Setting Up the App

### Prerequisites

There are number of things that you have to have installed on your machine in order for this app to work. These are:
* Ruby
* SQLite3
* Node.js
* Yarn
* Rails

The [Rails Getting Started Guide](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html) includes detailed instructions on how to install these in the "3 Creating New Rails Project" section. Follow all the steps in 3.1, but *do not continue onto any other steps past 3.1*

Once you've verified that all of these prerequisites are installed and functional, continue with the steps below.

### Getting going

1. Create a github repo named `notabee`
2. Copy all of the contents of this repo into your new repo
3. Enter the `api` directory, eg `cd api`
4. Run `rails db:create` (create the dev database)
5. Run `rails db:migrate` (migrate the database to the current schema)
6. Run `rails db:seed` (seed the database with fake data)
7. Run `bundle install` (install ruby gem dependencies)
8. Enter the `frontend` directory, eg `cd ../frontend`
9. Run `yarn install` (install npm dependencies)
10. Start the Rails server by entering the `api` directory and running `rails s`
11. Start the Vue server by entering the `frontend` directory and running `yarn serve`

(If you're on Mac/Linux, you can also run the `./bootstrap.sh` script from the root directory, which does the exact same things as steps 3-9 above.)

**At this point, when you go to localhost:8080 on your local browser, you should see an operational Notabee app, populated with your seeded data fetched from your databsae through your Rails Server running on localhost:3000.** Play around with the app!

(We are *not* trying to trip you up with any of these steps, and we recognize that everybody's machine might work a little bit differently. If you run into an issues up to this point, please send me an email at <jmenden@simplenexus.com>)

## Your Assignment

Time Estimate: 1 hour

1. You'll notice that, for each note, there's an empty "Created At" field. Luckily, we already store that information in the `created_at` column of the database. Fetch that information from the DB through GraphQL and surface that in the UI. Bonus points if you make the Timestamp human-friendly
<details>
  <summary>Hint</summary>
  On the frontend, you should add the created_at field to the query in <code>frontend/src/components/NotesDashboard.vue</code> , now just to figure out where it should go on the backend...
</details>

2. Shawn Hornet really prefers to see his *oldest* notes first and his *newest* notes last. Can you display the notes according to Shawn's preferences?
<details>
  <summary>Hint</summary>
  There's a one-line, one-word fix for this in the backend.
</details>

3. You'll notice that the delete button doesn't really work right now â€” it just shows an alert. Implement a new GraphQL Mutation that deletes the note and refreshes the data when that button is clicked.
<details>
  <summary>Hint</summary>
  Try to study and understand what the app is doing for the <code>AddNote</code> mutation, since this will behave very similarly.
</details>

## Next-Level

If you have extra time, or are feeling ambitious, here are some extra assignments you can take on.

1. The "Delete" button on the notes is in a different place on each note and that looks really disorganized. Can you figure out a way to make the "Delete" button show up in a consistent place on the note component?
<details>
  <summary>Hint</summary>
  Maybe there's a way to utilize Vuetify's out-of-the-box <a href="https://vuetifyjs.com/en/components/grids/" target="_blank">grid system</a> here?
</details>

2. Shawn Hornet is nearly done with Hamlet, and he realizes he wants a way to keep track of the source of his notes. Add a new field to the `Note` model named `source`, add a text field for Shawn to enter the source when creating a new note, and surface this field in the UI
<details>
  <summary>Hint</summary>
  This will require creating a rails database migration.
</details>

## Feeling ðŸ’¯

Shawn Hornet and the rest of us SimpleNexians will be very impressed if you complete this task!

1. Create a `Dockerfile` for both the frontend and the backend, and a `docker-compose.yml` file that builds and runs those docker images in such a way that by running `docker-compose up` you can see Notabee running.


## Deliverables

Make your repo public and share the repo URL with me at <jmenden@simplenexus.com> with Subject title "Notabee Repo".

## Getting Oriented & Helpful Resources

In this repo, you'll find two folders:
* The `api` folder is a [Ruby on Rails API](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html) â€” this is Notabee's **backend**
  * The code you will be dealing with is in the `api/app` directory.
  * Although Rails is traditionally a [Model-View-Controller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller) framework, Notabee actually runs a [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) server, so for the purposes of this exercise, you can mostly ignore the `api/app/views` and `api/app/controllers` folders.
  * The files that will most interest you will be found in `api/app/graphql` and `api/app/models`
  * Notabee uses the [GraphQL Ruby](https://graphql-ruby.org/getting_started) library for GraphQL
* The `frontend` folder, which is a [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/) Single-Page App â€”Â this is Notabee's **frontend**
  * The code you will be dealing with in the frontend is in the `frontend/src` directory
  * Specifically, the `frontend/src/App.vue` and `frontend/src/components` files
  * On the frontend Notabee uses the [Vue Apollo](https://apollo.vuejs.org/guide/apollo/) library to connect to the GraphQL backend
  * All of the components used here come from the [Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/introduction/why-vuetify/) framework library

GraphQL can be difficult to understand. We've provided a playground for you at `localhost:3000/graphiql` where you can test out GraphQL queries and mutations.
